### 1. What is Node
- Node.js is a runtime environment for java script, which runs on server. `Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library`
- Node.js is free, open source server environment which could be runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.). 
- Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.


### 2. Feature of Nodejs
- **Asynchronous and Event Driven** - Node.js servers are asynchronous,non-blocking. Means it never waits for API to return data. It simply moves to next process if any process took more time to execute. 
- **Single Threaded but Highly Scalable** - Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable 
- **No Buffering** - Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

### 3. How to install on your system
- Download Node.js Installer. In a web browser, navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install Node.js and NPM from Browser. Once the installer finishes downloading, launch it.
- Verify Installation.
