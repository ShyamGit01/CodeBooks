## Prommiss
 - A promise is a special JavaScript object that links the “producing code” and the “consuming code” together. In terms of our [analogy](https://github.com/ShyamGit01/CodeBooks/blob/main/Node/Terms.md#Analogy): this is the “subscription list”. The “producing code” takes whatever time it needs to produce the promised result, and the “promise” makes that result available to all of the subscribed code when it’s ready.

## Analogy
