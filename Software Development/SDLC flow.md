# Standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) flow

  The flow of software development from requirement gathering to delivery follows a structured sequence of phases. This process ensures that the software meets business needs, is high quality, and is delivered on time. Below is the standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) flow:

## ✅ 1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
- Objective: Understand what the client/business wants.
- Activities:
  - Collect functional and non-functional requirements (via meetings, workshops, documentation).
  - Identify business goals, constraints, and success criteria.
  - Analyze feasibility (technical, financial, operational).
- Deliverables:
  - Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
  - Use Cases / User Stories.

## ✅ 2. Planning
- Objective: Define the roadmap to build the software.
- Activities:
  - Effort estimation (story points, hours, cost).Resource allocation (team, tools, tech stack).
  - Risk analysis & mitigation planning.
  - Schedule creation (project timeline, milestones).
- Deliverables:
  - Project Plan.
  - Risk Management Plan.
 
## ✅ 3. System Design (High-Level & Low-Level)
- Objective: Translate requirements into technical design.
- Activities:
  - High-Level Design (HLD): Architecture design, technology stack selection, database selection, external integrations.
  - Low-Level Design (LLD): Component-level design, class diagrams, database schema, APIs definition.
  - UI/UX design (wireframes, prototypes).
- Deliverables:
  - HLD and LLD documents.
  - Wireframes/Mockups.

## ✅ 4. Implementation / Development
- Objective: Actual coding of the software.
- Activities:
  - Set up development environment, version control (Git).
  - Code features as per LLD.
  - Follow coding standards, write unit tests.
  - Peer code reviews.
- Deliverables:
  - Working code (feature branches, merged to main branch).
  - Unit Test Cases.

## ✅ 5. Testing / Quality Assurance
- Objective: Ensure software is bug-free and meets requirements.
- Types of Testing:
  - Unit Testing – Test individual components.
  - Integration Testing – Test combined modules.
  - System Testing – End-to-end validation.
  - User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validation by end-users.
  - Performance & Security Testing – Non-functional requirements.
- Deliverables:
  - Test Cases & Test Reports.
  - Defect Logs.

## ✅ 6. Deployment / Delivery
- Objective: Release the software to production or client.
- Activities:
  - Prepare deployment environment (servers, cloud setup, CI/CD pipelines).
  - Deploy to staging → production.
  - Validate post-deployment (smoke testing).
  - User training (if needed).
- Deliverables:
  - Production-ready software.
  - Deployment Guide & User Manuals.
 
## ✅ 7. Maintenance & Support
- Objective: Ensure software remains operational post-release.
- Activities:
  - Monitor performance, error logs.
  - Fix production bugs (patches).
  - Handle change requests and new feature enhancements.
- Deliverables:
  - Updated software versions.
  - Support Tickets Resolution.

## ✅ Example : Complete SDLC for ToDo App (React + MongoDB)
### 1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
**Activities**
- **Functional Requirements:**
   - Add a task with:
     - Task Name (string)
     - Priority (Low, Medium, High)
     - Reminder Time (DateTime)
     - Completion Status (boolean)
   - Fetch tasks:
     - Priority-wise sorting
     - Time-wise sorting
  - Update / Delete tasks.
- **Non-functional Requirements:**
  - Should be responsive (desktop & mobile).
  - Should store data persistently in MongoDB.
  - Should handle at least ~10K tasks per user.
- **Feasibility Analysis:**
  - Technical: React (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend API), MongoDB (database).
  - Cost/Time: Simple app → Can be done by 1 developer in ~2-3 weeks.

### Deliverables
✅ Software Requirement Specification (SRS Document) → (You should at least keep it as a simple Notion/Markdown doc for clarity).

## 2. Planning
**Activities**
- **Tech Stack Decision:**
  - Frontend: React (with Tailwind or Material UI).
  - Backend: Node.js (Express) + Mongoose for MongoDB.
  - Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or local MongoDB.
- **Task Breakdown:**
  - API Endpoints (/tasks, /tasks/:id).
  - Frontend Pages (Task List, Add/Edit Task Form).
- **Timeline:**
  -  Week 1 → Backend API & DB setup.
  -  Week 2 → Frontend Integration & Testing.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Reminder Notifications (if required in real-time, may need cron jobs or external services like Firebase).

### Deliverables
✅ Project Plan (even a simple Trello/Jira board or checklist works).

## 3. System Design
**3.1 High-Level Design (HLD)**
- **Architecture:**
```
React (Frontend) → REST API (Express) → MongoDB
```
- **Data Flow:**
  - User adds/updates tasks → API → MongoDB.
  - User fetches tasks → API retrieves sorted tasks → React displays.
**3.2 Low-Level Design (LLD)**
- **Database Schema (MongoDB / Mongoose Model):**
```
{
  taskName: String,
  priority: { type: String, enum: ["Low", "Medium", "High"] },
  reminderTime: Date,
  isCompleted: Boolean,
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}
```
- **API Endpoints:**
  - POST /tasks → Add Task
  - GET /tasks?sort=priority|time → Fetch Tasks sorted
  - PUT /tasks/:id → Update Task
  - DELETE /tasks/:id → Delete Task
- **UI Wireframes:**
  - Task List Page (table/list with sort options).
  - Add/Edit Task Form.

### Deliverables**
✅ HLD & LLD (could be simple diagrams in Figma / Draw.io).

## 4. Implementation (Development)
**Activities**
- **Backend:**
  - Setup Express server, connect to MongoDB with Mongoose.
  - Implement CRUD APIs.
  - Use Postman to test APIs.
- **Frontend:**
  - Create React components:
    - TaskList (fetch & display).
    - TaskForm (add/update).
  - Axios or Fetch API to call backend.
- **Coding Standards:**
  - Follow ESLint rules, proper folder structure.
- **Unit Testing (at least basic):**
  - Use Jest or Mocha/Chai for backend functions.

### Deliverables
✅ Working backend + frontend code in Git.

## 5. Testing
**Types**
- **Unit Testing** → API endpoint tests.
- **Integration Testing** → Check frontend ↔ backend data flow.
- **System Testing** → End-to-end manual testing (adding, fetching sorted tasks).
- **UAT (Optional)** → If you have users/stakeholders to verify.

✅ Prepare Test Cases (even in Excel or Markdown).

### 6. Deployment / Delivery
**Activities**
- **Backend:**
  - Deploy Node.js API to Render, Railway, or AWS.
  - Host MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas.
- **Frontend:**
  - Deploy React app to Vercel or Netlify.
- **Post-Deployment Validation:**
  - Verify that tasks can be added, fetched, and updated in production.

### Deliverables
✅ Deployment Guide (document environment URLs, credentials).

## 7. Maintenance & Support
- Fix any production bugs.
- Add new features (e.g., push notifications, user authentication).

### ✅ Final SDLC Flow (Summary)
```
Requirement Gathering → Planning → HLD/LLD Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
```
