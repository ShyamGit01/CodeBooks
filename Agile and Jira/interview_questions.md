## 5. What is a Sprint?
A **time-boxed** period (usually 2 weeks) during which a potentially shippable product increment is developed.

## 6. What are Scrum Ceremonies?
- **Sprint Planning** â€“ Define work for the sprint

## 7. What are the pillars of Scrum?
1. **Transparency**  
2. **Inspection**  
3. **Adaptation**  

## 8. What is the Product Backlog?
An **ordered list of work** to be done, maintained by the Product Owner. Includes features, enhancements, fixes, technical debt, etc.

## 9. What is a User Story?
A simple description of a feature from an end-userâ€™s perspective.  
**Format**:  
`As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].`

## 10. What is INVEST?

## 11. What is a Definition of Done (DoD)?
A **checklist** agreed upon by the team to define when a task is considered **complete**.

## 12. What is velocity?
The amount of work a team completes in a sprint, usually measured in **story points**.

## 13. What is a Burndown Chart?
A visual representation of **remaining work** vs. **time**.

## 14. What is a Burnup Chart?
Shows the **total scope** and **completed work** to track progress and scope changes.

## 15. What happens if priorities change mid-sprint?
- Stick to the sprint goal  
- Push changes to the next sprint  
- In critical cases, cancel and replan sprint

## 16. What is a Spike?
A **time-boxed research task** used to gather knowledge necessary to reduce risk or understand a requirement.

## 17. What is technical debt and how to manage it?
**Technical debt** refers to shortcuts or poor solutions that require refactoring later.  
Manage by:
- Creating separate tickets  
- Allocating time in each sprint  
- Prioritizing based on impact

## 18. What is Jira?
A **project management tool** used to plan, track, and manage Agile projects. Popular for Scrum, Kanban, and Bug Tracking.

## 19. What are Epics, Stories, and Tasks in Jira?

| Item  | Description                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------|

| Story | User feature/requirement             |
| Task  | Technical or operational work        |

## 20. What is JQL?
**Jira Query Language** to search and filter issues.  
Example:
```jql
project = "ABC" AND status = "In Progress" AND assignee = currentUser()
```

## 21. What are Jira Workflows?
Define how an issue transitions from one state to another. Includes:
- **Statuses** (To Do, In Progress, Done)  
- **Transitions**  
- **Validators**, **Conditions**, **Post-functions**

## 22. What are Jira Schemes?
Configuration sets that define:
- Permissions  
- Notifications  
- Workflows  
- Issue types

## 23. How do you manage dependencies in Jira?
- Use **Linked Issues** (blocks, is blocked by, relates to)  
- Visualize using **Advanced Roadmaps** or Gantt plugins

## 24. How do you handle over-commitment?
- Track and analyze **velocity**  
- Adjust planning in next sprint  
- Reflect in retrospectives

## 25. What tools integrate well with Jira?
- **Confluence** for documentation  
- **Bitbucket/GitHub** for code  
- **Slack** for communication  
- **Jenkins/GitLab** for CI/CD
